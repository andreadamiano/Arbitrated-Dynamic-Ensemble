Chapter X: Methodology
1. Introduction to the Methodology
Briefly outline the overall approach and objectives of your study.

State the motivation for combining linear and non-linear modeling (SARIMA + residual learning) and the rationale for using an arbitrated dynamic ensemble.

Highlight the novelty of integrating residual learning with dynamic ensembling for improved predictions.

2. Overview of the Workflow
Provide a high-level diagram (flowchart) of your methodology, showing the steps:

SARIMA modeling for linear dependencies.

Residual extraction and non-linear modeling (machine/deep learning).

Ensembling via arbitrated dynamic ensemble.

Final prediction aggregation (summing linear and non-linear predictions).

Explain the workflow in 2–3 paragraphs to guide the reader.

3. Data Preparation and Preprocessing
Describe the datasets used (e.g., time series data, features, sample size).

Mention any preprocessing steps:

Handling missing values, outliers, or stationarity (e.g., differencing for SARIMA).

Train-test splits, normalization, or windowing for deep learning.

4. Step 1: Capturing Linear Dependencies with SARIMA
4.1 SARIMA Model Selection

Explain how you identified the optimal SARIMA parameters (e.g., (p, d, q)(P, D, Q, S)).

Mention tools/approaches used (e.g., ACF/PACF plots, grid search, AIC/BIC criteria).

4.2 Training and Validation

Describe how the SARIMA model was trained and validated (e.g., time-series cross-validation).

Highlight performance metrics (e.g., RMSE, MAE) for baseline evaluation.

4.3 Residual Extraction

Explain how residuals were calculated (observed – SARIMA predictions) and their role in capturing unmodeled patterns.

5. Step 2: Residual Learning for Non-Linear Dependencies
5.1 Model Selection for Residuals

Describe the machine/deep learning models used (e.g., LSTM, Random Forest, XGBoost).

Justify their suitability for capturing non-linear patterns in residuals.

5.2 Training Process

Explain how residuals were used as the target variable for training.

Detail hyperparameter tuning (e.g., grid search, Bayesian optimization).

5.3 Validation of Residual Model

Report performance metrics to demonstrate the model’s ability to predict residuals.

6. Step 3: Arbitrated Dynamic Ensemble
6.1 Concept of Arbitrated Dynamic Ensembling

Define the technique (cite sources if it’s an established method, or explain your adaptation).

Explain how "arbitration" works (e.g., dynamic weighting of models based on performance, meta-learners, or context-aware selection).

6.2 Implementation Details

Describe how predictions from SARIMA and residual models are combined (e.g., weighted average, stacking).

Specify the arbitration mechanism (e.g., meta-model for weighting, rules for dynamic adjustment).

6.3 Advantages of the Approach

Contrast with static ensembling (e.g., why dynamic arbitration is better suited for your problem).

7. Final Prediction Aggregation
Explain how the linear (SARIMA) and non-linear (ensemble) predictions are summed to produce the final output.

Discuss any weighting or scaling applied (if not a simple sum).

Justify why summation is appropriate (e.g., additive nature of linear/non-linear components).

8. Evaluation Framework
8.1 Performance Metrics

List metrics used (e.g., RMSE, MAE, MAPE, R²) and why they are suitable for your problem.

8.2 Benchmarking

Compare your ensemble’s performance against standalone SARIMA, residual models, and baseline methods.

8.3 Statistical Validation

Mention tests for significance (e.g., Diebold-Mariano test) to confirm improvement.

9. Implementation Tools and Libraries
Briefly list tools used (e.g., Python, statsmodels for SARIMA, TensorFlow/Keras for deep learning, scikit-learn for ensembling).

Mention computational resources (e.g., GPU usage for deep learning).

10. Summary
Recap the methodology in 1–2 paragraphs, emphasizing the synergy between linear, non-linear, and ensemble components.

Tips for Clarity
Use pseudocode or equations (if applicable) to formalize key steps (e.g., SARIMA formula, residual learning, ensemble aggregation).

Include visualizations (e.g., SARIMA diagnostics, residual plots, ensemble architecture).

Address limitations of your approach (e.g., assumptions of SARIMA, computational complexity of dynamic ensembling).
