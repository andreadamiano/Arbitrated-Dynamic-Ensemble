abstract = {Cloud computing is a powerful technology to perform massive-scale and complex computing. It eliminates the need to maintain expensive computing hardware, dedicated space, and software. Massive growth in the scale of data or big data generated through cloud computing has been observed. Addressing big data is a challenging and time-demanding task that requires a large computational infrastructure to ensure successful data processing and analysis. The rise of big data in cloud computing is reviewed in this study. The definition, characteristics, and classification of big data along with some discussions on cloud computing are introduced. The relationship between big data and cloud computing, big data storage systems, and Hadoop technology are also discussed. Furthermore, research challenges are investigated, with focus on scalability, availability, data integrity, data transformation, data quality, data heterogeneity, privacy, legal and regulatory issues, and governance. Lastly, open research issues that require substantial research efforts are summarized.}

abstract = {In the Yule analysis the sunspot number for a given year is a function of those for the two preceding years and a presumed random disturbance. As Yule noted, however, the disturbances are not random and change sign at approximately 40 y intervals. The Yule methodology developed into what is now known as autoregressive time series analysis, in which the emphasis is on prediction and periodicity analysis. This study, by contrast, emphasizes the disturbances, and relates their temporal behavior to the shifts in latitudinal preferences observed in auroral occurrence. That is, auroral occurrence would be preferentially in the South for a time and then shift, over a relatively short period of time, to the North. The shift was observed in data from both Sweden and the United States. This behavior would then be repeated over subsequent intervals. The present paper compares the North/South behavior of Swedish auroras with the disturbances deduced from a Yule analysis of sunspots for approximately the past two centuries. Overall, though not exactly on a one-for-one basis, the northward movements occur during periods of low disturbances, and the southward movements during periods of high disturbances. It is tentatively proposed here that the general magnetic field of the sun, reflected also in the interplanetary field, joins the two phenomena. The results also support the proposal of Silverman that there are two branches in the relationship between auroral occurrence and sunspot maxima. In one branch, consisting of a minority of all cycles, the frequency of auroral occurrence is less than what might be expected from the main branch. Comparison with the derived sunspot disturbances shows that the average disturbance for the aurorally deficient branch is considerably lower than that for all cycles.}
