Non-Tradability of Predictions
In real-world trading, simply predicting price directions or technical indicator levels may not be sufficient for creating profitable strategies. For instance, when a model predicts the future value of a technical indicator based on lagged prices, it might indicate whether the indicator will be above or below a certain threshold, but this prediction is non-tradable unless it incorporates an action plan for execution. A prediction that a certain indicator will rise tomorrow might be accurate, but without actionable trade signals (e.g., when to buy or sell), it might not result in a tradable strategy.
